I just finished my motivation letter for masters in Europe. And my native tongue is not English, so I have a feeling that I made many mistakes which I can not see. Please read my letter, and I would appreciate any kind of suggestions and corrections on the idea and grammar. Thank you guys!!! And all the best to everyone.<br>Dear Sir or Madam,<br>I am writing to apply for the Master's Program in Computer Science field (preferably Software Engineering), which I am enormously interested. I believe that the degree from one of the most recognized technical university is definitely my chance to deepen my knowledge and make progress in my future career thus contribute to the society I will live in.<br>Above all, I would like to start about how I became interested in computers. In high school I always had a keen interest in Mathematics. My parents put me in one of the best schools in Mongolia which has more intensive mathematics' classes compare to other schools, and by doing that they have installed in me commitment to the subject since the first day of school. Mathematics had been my favorite subject until my 10th standard when the school started offering classes in computer science field. Even though many children in school was fascinated about using a computer, all the thing we learn from that weekly-once class was almost nothing more than filling shapes with colors in Paint program on Windows 98. However our Informatics' teacher started the after-school intensive classes for the students who want know deeper about the computers. Due to my extremely curious nature, I obviously joined the class right away. At first class, our teacher introduced us to Pascal programming language and wrote a program to check whether the number inputted was prime or not and displayed the results on computer screen. Here, I must say that one of the very few things I hate about mathematics was testing whether a number is prime. As we all know, a prime number is a natural number which has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So in order to check primality, we had to divide it by all the natural numbers from 1 to its square root. And I can assure you this can be extremely tedious procedure if the given number is more than 4 digits long. But on that day, at that class, I witnessed my teacher has checked 8 digit number's primality within less than a minute just by clicking the 'enter' key. And I was watching it with astonished eyes just like the 5 year old girl watching the magician to pull out rabbit from his empty hat. It was that magical to me. Since every great magic has a trick behind it, from that day I have become obsessed with the "tricks" behind 'Computer'.<br>After high school I wanted to study computers because I was sure that it was the one sole thing I would never grow tired of. However there were no good schools in Mongolia at that time. Outdated technology is always a curse for developing countries. While students in western countries were writing codes with C++ and using object oriented methods, we were learning to declare the variables in Pascal. Thus I set my goal to pursue my dream in some other country where IT sector is developed well. Then I joined the National University of Mongolia and started taking various English language classes instead of computer ones. Later in my sophomore year, I took an exam for Indian Government Scholarship, came at top of the all students and won the full scholarship to study Bachelor of Computer Applications at the University of ...., India.<br>During three years of studying at the university in India, I obtained a broad and solid base on computer science and application, specially coding and programming through textbooks and practical trainings. However you may guess that I was the more like "lab-geek" than the book one. Maybe that explains the relatively high marks (almost all above 98) on my practical exam in each semester. Though my studies at university, I have gained extensive knowledge on various subjects such as networking, wireless technology, data mining techniques, SQL server, Oracle, various operating systems, data structures as well as programming languages including Java, C, C++. Moreover I have got decent knowledge on network security and Python programming language through my personal interests.<br>To enrich my practical experience and programming skills, additionally I joined one year course on Java technology at the NIIT, one of the well known IT training institutes in Asia. During this course, I had an opportunity to study Java programming language in depth and I was introduced to the technologies such as J2EE, EJB, JDBC, GlassFish server as well as Netbeans IDE, and learned about developing web and business applications. Through this course I understood that creating the application for end user is a lot more than just writing a code, it is complex and complicated job including design, maintenance, bug fixing, and development etc. Then after taking software testing and software engineering class on my 5th and 6th semesters at University, my interest in software engineering grow bigger than just writing a code alone. Though I am feel that my knowledge on this field is limited, so I believe your master's program on Computer Science/will suit my interest.<br>Lastly, I am convinced that with my motivation and experience I gained from my academic study, I can be good candidate for your master's program. I will try my best to contribute strongly to the excellence and the diversity of your program, as well as the international community of the University.<br>Thank you for your consideration. I am looking forward to your positive reply.<br>Yours Sincerely,<br><br><ins class="adsbygoogle abg1 db" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4504722976547079" data-ad-slot="8969987266" data-ad-format="auto" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="height: 90px;"><ins id="aswift_0_expand" style="display:inline-table;border:none;height:90px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:1026px;background-color:transparent"><ins id="aswift_0_anchor" style="display:block;border:none;height:90px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:1026px;background-color:transparent"><iframe width="1026" height="90" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" vspace="0" hspace="0" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" onload="var i=this.id,s=window.google_iframe_oncopy,H=s&amp;&amp;s.handlers,h=H&amp;&amp;H[i],w=this.contentWindow,d;try{d=w.document}catch(e){}if(h&amp;&amp;d&amp;&amp;(!d.body||!d.body.firstChild)){if(h.call){setTimeout(h,0)}else if(h.match){try{h=s.upd(h,i)}catch(e){}w.location.replace(h)}}" id="aswift_0" name="aswift_0" style="left:0;position:absolute;top:0;" src="./Motivation letter Computers_SW engineering_files/saved_resource.html"></iframe></ins></ins></ins><script src="./Motivation letter Computers_SW engineering_files/ca-pub-4504722976547079.js.download"></script><script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script><div class="cb"></div></div></article><article><div class="sp pTx2"><div class="fl"><a target="_blank" class="tooltip" href="https://essayforum.com/index.php?action=userinfo&amp;user=82127"><b>Classical</b><span>Threads: <b>1</b><br>Posts: <b>4</b><br>Author: <b>Tayo Oladunjoye</b></span></a>  <span id="likesamnt_82127_221342"> </span>  &nbsp;     </div><div class="fr">Jan 18, 2014  &nbsp; <a id="msg221342" href="https://essayforum.com/graduate/motivation-computers-engineering-55234/#msg221342" class="hwm txtNr">#2</a></div><div class="cb"></div></div><div class="pTx">You need to talk about your contribution to your community even your goal after graduation. who want know deeper about the computers (who want to know)<div class="cb"></div></div></article><article><div class="sp pTx2"><div class="fl"><a target="_blank" class="tooltip" href="https://essayforum.com/index.php?action=userinfo&amp;user=25160"><b>dumi</b><span>Threads: <b>1</b><br>Posts: <b>7,592</b><br>Author: <b>Duminda</b></span></a>  <span id="likesamnt_25160_223733"> <img src="./Motivation letter Computers_SW engineering_files/likesm.png" alt="" title="Likes" class="likE"> 1592</span>  &nbsp;     </div><div class="fr">Feb 16, 2014  &nbsp; <a id="msg223733" href="https://essayforum.com/graduate/motivation-computers-engineering-55234/#msg223733" class="hwm txtNr">#3</a></div><div class="cb"></div></div><div class="pTx">I am writing to apply for the Master's Program in Computer Science field (preferably Software Engineering),<span style="color:#FF0000"> in </span>which I am<del> enormously</del> <span style="color:#FF0000">very</span> interested.
