Dear Sirs, Madams

I am interested to apply for a Master’s Degree Program in {name od the programme} starting in 2013. I graduated in 2011, from the University of {name od the University}, USA and hold a Bachelors degree in {name od the programme}.

The four year undergraduate program in {name od the programme}  formed the basis of my perseverance towards achieving an in-depth knowledge in the field of –. As a part of my degree course I studied various subjects relating to diverse aspects of {specify} which includes {specify}.


During my bachelor studies, I underwent the experience of developing a {specify}. Under the supervision of Prof {name} along with my colleague I have prepared the {specify}. While submitting the assignment, our lecturer observed {specify}  and recommended our product for {specify}-.

Upon receiving this acknowledgment of my work I would like to carry on my penchant for {specify}, as this {methodology, issue} is gaining increasing importance, in all aspects and is having significant impact on almost all industries and all areas of society. There is an ample scope to prove one’s ability, competence and intelligence in this revolutionary and potentially very beneficial {methodology, issue, theory}.

Besides the college academics I was actively involved in the extra-curricular activities. The driving force behind all this was my aim to develop all the facets of my personality. In this process I could not achieve the grades I wanted to, in the first and second year. But soon I garnered the skill of judicious allocation of time and energy. I do not feel that the marks I scored are the sole indicators of my understanding of the subject. A cogent reason to augment my belief is the final year of my studies, where with strong focus and hard work, I excelled in my graduation with distinction. Considering my excellent record, my college offered me for a job as a lecturer.


Also for the past twenty months I have been working as a {specify}- in -{specify} department of -{specify}. My work has helped me develop a thorough insight into return to the academic world for further growth. It has given me the confidence to pursue a Master’s degree and also kindled a desire to do research.This career with open prospects has given me constant incentive to improve myself and to gain more knowledge.

Today I perceive that life for me has been a process of conscious evolution. An integral part of this growth has been the value system imbibed in me by my parents, teachers and mentors and an immense liking for science. As I embark upon a new stage of my life, I believe that a postgraduate study will provide a milestone in my career along with invaluable experiences that will allow me to become a successful, innovative professional and assist in accomplishing my goals. Ten years from now, I envisage myself as a full-fledged research professional in an organization, or a faculty member at some leading university.

My decision to pursue graduate studies in the United Kingdom is underscored by my desire to be a part of the graduate program at your institution. The pioneering works going on at the -{specify}-department , which include the development of {specify}, perfectly match with the field of my interest. The interdisciplinary nature of {specify programme, field} has convinced me in taking this decision as it is the ideal choice for an exciting research career.

By working under the guidance of distinguished faculty, I shall certainly be able to exploit my potential to the fullest.

The department web site revealed very strong faculty like Prof. {NAME} involved in extensive research in the area of {specify}. This has strengthened my resolve to study at University of {NAME}. I am confident that the erudite faculty will make my learning experience extraordinary. If I get the opportunity to be a part of that intellectually stimulating environment, I am sure my talents will be put to optimal use.

I am confident that overall opportunity to study in Europe will broaden my horizons and give me an opportunity to gain world class education and help me become an excellent world citizen.
