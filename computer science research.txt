Since my undergraduate study I was always interested in Enterprise solutions and my short career is full of developing enterprise systems specially large scalable systems. I aspire to expand my knowledge and understanding of large scalable systems by studying Distributed computing as distribution of workload among cluster of machines is a must to design a large scalable Enterprise system. Moreover I want to research and write my thesis in the same field.
