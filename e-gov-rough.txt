Dear Sir/Madam,

With this letter, I would like to express my interest in studying at the Tallinn university of technology in e-Governance Technologies and Services MSc programme.

The use of e-government in public organizations and public administration are rising across the world. Many governments are using information and communication technology(ICT), to provide services between government agencies , citizens, and other nongovernmental agencies. The adoption and use of the e-government strategy can provide significant benefits for government as this will reduce cost, improve service quality, and provide transparency. I can explain this with a case study: one local body in my city collects Tax from 1 Million customer through manual mode and maintains individual registers for them. Enormous Manpower is required and the chances of data errors and funds mismanagement are vast. Now if this was transformed to a Web Based application with online payment mode and Citizen Portal, would improve the efficiency as well as transparency.

According to the Japan Times "Japan has launched a digital identification program called MyNumber, which helps residents access and manage a range of government services online, from social security to income taxes". I believe Japan has taken Estonia as an example which is the vanguard of all states in using ICT in public sector and governance. "Estonia’s success in converting their public services online is first and foremost based on the widespread use of electronic identification cards" according to June 2015, World bank report. This Baltic nation has developed X-Road to ensure secure communication between scattered government databases and institutions that use different procedures and technologies to deliver their services. Through e-ID and X-Road plateform Estonia offers numerous convenient online services to their citizens including  electronic tax filing, online medical prescriptions and, ultimately, internet voting. Residents who use the system save time and money and it also provides direct communication between government and citizens which ensures transparency. The World Bank quantified the savings more precisely: the annual of human-to-human queries was approximately 113 million. If every query saved 15 minutes a total of 2.8 million hours was saved which is equivalent to 3225 people working continuously 24/7 for one year. From all these data it is clearly visible that government saving huge resources as well as citizens are using e-government services more conveniently.
