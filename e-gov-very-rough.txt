Question one: clearly defined perspectives and motivation for developing the information society and e-government era (max. points given 2)
The waves of e-government are rising through public organizations and public administration across the world. More and more governments are using information and communication technology especially Internet or web-based network, to provide services between government agencies and citizens, businesses, employees and other nongovernmental agencies. By improving country's capacity to provide services, achieve policy goals, and increase efficiency and transparency, e-Government encourages greater trust, participation and engagement of citizens. I am explaining this with a case study: One local body in my city collects Tax from 1.2Million customer through manual mode and maintains individual registers for them. Enormous Manpower is required and the chances of data errors and funds mismanagement are vast. Now if this was transformed to a Web Based application with online payment mode and online Citizen Portal, would improve the efficiency as well as transparency.

I believe, use of modern information and communication technologies in public sector and governance has placed the Estonia at the vanguard of states. In the year of 2016, Japan has taken Estonia as an example and launched a digital identification program called MyNumber, which helps residents access and manage a range of government services online, from social security to income taxes. "Estonia’s success in converting their public services online is first and foremost based on the widespread use of electronic identification cards" according to World bank report[4]. Estonia has developed X-Road to ensure secure communication between scattered government databases and institutions that use different procedures and technologies to deliver their services. Through e-ID and X-Road plateform Estonia offers numerous convenient online services to their citizens including  electronic tax filing, online medical prescriptions and, ultimately, internet voting. Residents who use the system save time and money. For example a car can be sold online in 15 minutes, filing an online tax declaration takes at most five minutes, and Internet voting takes 90 seconds on average[1]. The World Bank quantified the savings more precisely in its June 2015 report.  in 2014 the annual of human-to-human queries was approximately 113 million. It means that if every query saved 15 minutes a total of 2.8 million hours, or 3225 years of time was saved. The comprehensive and intuitive interpretation of this number would posit that a time saved by X-Road in 2014 amounts to 3225 people working continuously 24/7 for one year[1].

I am very interested about m-Government more specifically m-ID. Estonia has already developed Mobile-ID. According to e-estonia.com "the system is based on a specialized Mobile-ID SIM card which the customer must request from the mobile phone operator"[1]. I want to conduct a research project on Mobile-ID based on HCE(Host Card Emulation) technology where user credentials will be stored in cloud server rather than in Secure element or SIM card. This will help getting rid of third party like mobile phone operator and help citizens to use e-government services more conveniently. The goal of my research to develop on single application by which all services like paying tax, internet voting can be done.
