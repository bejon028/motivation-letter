Dear Sir/Madam

I am writing to apply for master's programme in Software Engineering. I believe this degree from your esteemed institution which is one of the most reputed technical universities would help me deepen my knowledge and help me to achieve my career goal.

My journey in this area of computing started with Introduction to Computer System and Structured Programming Language courses where I wrote first "hello world" code in C. It was my first taste of success in practical programming but aspiration of going for higher degrees and building a career in the same area built in my mind from very young age. When I was at the age of 11, my elder brother brought a computer into home. So from very young age I had a chance to get myself acquainted with computer. It's very obvious that a 11 years old boy will use computer only for playing video games. And there was no difference for me too but when I sat in front of computer, one question raised in my mind each and every time that is how the whole system works? How I control elements on monitor by pressing keyboard or clicking mouse? One day I asked the question to my elder brother who was studying Civil Engineering at that time. My brother answered "You have to study computer science to understand all this". This one simple sentence amplified my curiosity toward computer science.

After completion of my higher secondary school, I enrolled for B.Sc. program in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology(BUET),most reputed university in Bangladesh, where I developed more interest towards computer science and graduated with 75% marks. During B.Sc, I studied almost all basic computer science courses which helped me to build a strong foundation to go for higher studies and choose a career in software engineering. Specialized areas in Programming Languages, Data Structures, Digital Logic Design, Algorithms, Software engineering, Computer Networks, Computer Architecture, Operating System and Database have been my strengths.

From my undergraduate studies I had become familiar with programming languages C, C++, JAVA, scripting languages like HTML, PHP, shell script, and databases like Oracle and MySQL. During my final year of study I along with one of my friends conducted a research identifying the heterogeneous traffic behavior of Dhaka city and develop a simulator which simulates traffic based on given road map and behavior. The goal of our research was to improve the present unpleasant condition of Dhaka traffic finding best combination of traffic rule, vehicle's behavior, and roads' condition. We used JAVA with NetBeans IDE, QGis for processing Open Street Map and shape files, and SQlite. We built a Map Parser as well to improve performance which process the map(OSM, shape file) into a compressed file that is taken as input for the simulator. After each simulation the simulator shows vehicle count and vehicle speed for each road in graph. I am providing github link of our simulator.

Upon graduating from BUET at march, 2016 I was offered job with KONA Software Lab Limited, REVE Systems, and Therap(BD) Ltd. I joined KONA Software Lab Limited as junior engineer which is Smart Card manufacturer and payment solution provider. My job was started with two month's training period where I learned basics of CSCIP/Payments, Spring framework, hibernate, Application Server, GIT, and software development methodologies like waterfall model, scrum and agile process. After successfully compilation of training I was assigned in "Kona Money" project. "Kona Money" is a NFC/QR code/barcode based payment system developed for South Korea. While working in "Kona Money" my team lead found that I was very eager to learn new technologies so he gave me a new challenging task, design and develop Authentication Server for Kona Local EMV project. Authentication Server is a server that authenticates users and provides token upon successful authentication. The provided token is used for granting access into different other servers. I have used JAVA with Spring boot, Oauth2, jwt(JSON Web Token), zuul proxy, IntelliJ IDEA IDE, and Gradle to develop the system. Currently I am Working in "KOD" project where we use AngularJS with JAVA(Spring).

During my undergraduate study period I was involved in various extracurricular activities. I was captain of my faculty cricket team, a member of voluntary blood donar's organization "Badhan". Moreover I like advantageous travelling like trekking. Being my faculty captain and a member of "Badhan", I had developed my managerial skills and had become a successful team member. From advantageous travelling I learned how to focus on my goal and work hard to achieve the goal. I found this activities highly beneficial for successfully working in software industry because collaboration between team members and being focused on same goal is very important to deliver a sound product. I also participated numerous programming contests. My team won 4th prize in inter university coding contest, 2014.

I have been working as a developer for almost a year. I want to be an entrepreneur after gathering few more years' industry experiences by working in a multinational software company. An immediate step towards my goal would be to pursue Masters Program in Software Engineering to enhance and sharpen my Software Engineering Knowledge. I came to know about University of Tartu's masters programme in Software Engineering while I was searching the Internet to find best suited programme for my career goal. The programme contains courses like Secure Programming Techniques, Advanced Programming, and Agile Software Development which will brush up my development skill. Moreover I will have a chance to complete my professional practice by undertaking an entrepreneurship project and to research on a practical software engineering problem which I found very gainful for my future career. Since Undergraduate study, I was always interested in enterprise softwares and my short career is full of developing enterprise software. I want learn more about enterprise systems and business analyses, and I want to be an International expert in enterprise systems.

Lastly, I am convinced that with my motivation and experience I have gained from my academic study and professional career, I can be good candidate for your master's program with scholarship. I will try my best to contribute strongly to the excellence and the diversity of your program, as well as the international community of the University.

Thank you for your consideration. I am looking forward to your positive reply.

Yours Sincerely
Bejon sarker
